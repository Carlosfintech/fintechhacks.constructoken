OpenPayments https://openpayments.dev/

Open Payments is an open API standard that can be implemented by account servicing entities to facilitate interoperability in the setup and completion of payments for different use cases.

NOTE: This payments workflow connects to `creator` identities rather than `actor` since payments belong to a person and not their persona.
